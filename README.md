# Recipe API

This is a project aiming to create an API for uploading / reading recipes from a database on Firebase Firestore using Flask in Python. The goal is to create a recipe suggester based on what ingredients are available at a given time. Some extensions to this include:

- Preferance system (create profile based on what have liked before, suggest these recipes higher)
- Similar recipes suggestor from source page
- Recommender system using Machine Learning
- Integration with Food delivery API (JustEat, Uber Eats, Deliveroo etc.) for suggestions of local restaurants which serve dish / similar
